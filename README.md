## History
Way back in the late 80s I started in BASIC using an ATARI 5200 personal computer with a BASIC cartridge.
Then in the early 90s I went to Concordia College learning Pascal and Assembly, with the college switching to C in my last year. So I ended up teaching myself the basics of C for my last classes. After college I ended up at a web startup that bombed and learned HTML, CSS, PHP and basic Javascripting. After that I was the lone computer programmer and IT guy at a soil tesitng lab, AGVISE Laboratories. This was mostly BASIC as it was all legacy systems, but I helped to at least get them into the Windows era with Visual Basic. There was also administering a legacy Novell server as well as a Windows server and getting it all to work. I also wrote a lot of automation for lab testing machines that had to duplicate tests that had been run by human beings. I joked I was part of the problem that I was talking the jobs of humans and giving them to machines and robots. After that I tried to start my own business, which did last for several years. But in the end I ended up at Amazon helping people selling products on the platform. During this time the world of programming moved on and languages like Go and Python came about. So now I am looking to get back into the world of programming learning the new languages. My past of object oriented and functional programming has still helped and as I have learned several languages I can easily pick up the specific syntax.
